Essential Gutenberg blocks in one plugin. Simple, flexible, and customizable.

== Description ==

Stackable adds the missing design blocks and options you need in the Gutenberg editor. Each block contains essential features to create a website from WordPress’ latest visual editor.

**12 Blocks so far and counting...**

> Note that this plugin is in alpha stage since Gutenberg hasn't been merged into core yet and is actively being developed. As things change in Gutenberg and as features, best practices and APIs arrive, things will also change in this plugin.

Stackable also gives Gutenberg users more options and settings to tinker with that aren't found in the current set Gutenberg blocks - like adjusting corner radius for buttons and different styled dividers.

With Stackable: Ultimate Blocks for Gutenberg, you get your essential blocks and more in a single install.

**You will need Gutenberg installed for this plugin to work**

Stackable extends Gutenberg's functionality, with the blocks built with effective usability in mind. It's a list of blocks designed to maintain the simplicity of Gutenberg:

6. Pullquote
7. Number box
8. Button (Improved!)

10. Expand / Show more
11. Divider (Improved!)
12. Spacer

We plan to add more in the future.

Each Stackable block has a set of unique features that can be modified. Change colors, tweak text sizes, change background images, add hover animations, and much more.

**1. Testimonials**

Lets you add simple yet stylish testimonial sections on your website. Add a text description, and choose between uploading a thumbnail image or icon for each testimonial.

**2. Team Members**

Familiarize your users with your team through individual photos and write-ups in columns. Comes with optional social media icons for each member.

**3. Call to Action**

Entice your users to take action. Feature your promos and alerts, and engage more with the Call to Action block.

Add alerts on your Gutenberg-built website for your users. Use these to notify your site visitors of promos, license expiration, and other important alerts. Choose from a range of basic settings and styles.

**5. Blockquote**

Extends the functionality of the current Gutenberg blockqoute by allowing you to change both text and background color.

**9. Ghost Button**

Just like the Button block, but presented  in a sleek, minimalistic way: outlines only.

**10. Expand / Show more**

Show snippets of text as short previews of longer text, and let visitors have the option to show more details.

Extended options for Gutenberg’s divider. Adjust height, weight, color, and more.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

You’ll need the **Gutenberg plugin** for this to work. Once you’ve downloaded both Gutenberg and your copy of Stackable, install both on your WordPress website, activate them, and you’re good to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is Gutenberg and why do I need it for Stackable to work?**

Gutenberg is a beta project by Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress. It’s a visual builder prototype of the new WordPress editor that’s coming out with WordPress 5.0 sometime this year.

Since it’s yet to be fully integrated with WordPress, Gutenberg comes as a separate plugin for developers and beta testers. Stackable is an add-on for the current Gutenberg plugin, so you’ll need both of them installed for you to use Stackable.

**Why would I need an add-on for Gutenberg?**

Currently, Gutenberg has some of the most basic features needed to create a website. However, we wanted to extend its current functionality by developing more options for designing and creating your Gutenberg-built website. Along with the additional blocks, Stackable also lets you change colors, edit text and shape sizes, and tweak your blocks styles.

**Can I use this add-on for other page builders I’m using?**

Nope. Stackable only works with Gutenberg.
