Map block for Gutenberg editor powered by Google Maps. Simple. Works. No nonsense.


== Description ==
Are you using Gutenberg and need a map? This is the block for you! Install, active, add to post. Done! No nonsense, no unneeded settings. Simple and clear in its function - as it should be.
Until Gutenberg gets merged into core, it requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg plugin</a>.


= Plugin Features =

Works as any other Gutenberg block with the following settings:
* address
* zoom
* height
* API key


== Installation ==

Standard stuff. Make sure you have the Gutenberg plugin installed, obviously.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Google Maps API key ... grrrr ... what where how!? =

Yes, yes, it's frustrating. See <a href="https://www.gmapswidget.com/documentation/generate-google-maps-api-key/">detailed instructions</a> from a similar plugin.
